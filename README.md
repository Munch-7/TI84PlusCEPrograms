# TI84PlusCEPrograms
A range of programs for the TI-84 Plus CE and TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition. 
I started writing these programs to automate some of the calculations done in Calculus 1 and have since expanded the programs to higher level calculus. There are single variable, multivariable, and vector calculus programs either completed or in progress. I have added a few random programs from Statistics due to the operating system on my calculator being out of date.
To put the program on a calculator, you will need to download the TI Connect Software from https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware and a cable to connect the calculator to a computer (this is usually the charging cable). Once the software and program are downloaded, start up the software. Then connect the calculator to the computer. On the left most column of the software, there should be a camera icon, a stack of files icon, and an icon of 3 squares. Click on the stack of files icon. Then at the top of the window, there is an icon of a computer with an arrow coming out of it. Select this icon. Navigate to the program wherever it is located. Select it and then which calculator to upload it to, and it should start uploading to the calculator. Once the pop up window disappears, it has been successfully upload. You can unplug the calculator.
