# TI84PlusCEPrograms
A range of programs for the TI-84 Plus CE and TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition. 
I started writing these programs to automate some of the calculations done in Calculus 1 and have since expanded the programs to higher level calculus. There are single variable, multivariable, and vector calculus programs either completed or in progress. I have added a few random programs from Statistics due to the operating system on my calculator being out of date.
